# Zone Touch 3 Integration

### About this integration

I was wanting to automate the Bathroom vent so I could have a warm environment for my morning activities. Was not able to find an integration that had the right features, so I destroyed my happiness by learning how to write a Home Assistant integration.

### Features
- Reflects live changes from physical control panel
- Populates fan names from those defined at the control panel
- Records temperature changes from control panel sensor
- Auto reconnects when connection to control panel lost
- Supports automation

Want another feature? Raise an issue and I'll see what I can do.

I suck at Python coding. I suck at Home Assistant integration coding.
